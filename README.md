# Project Info

Created in 2019, this platforming game served as a first experience of the difficulties and eventual joy that comes with game development. Going farther than the assignment called for, Platform Jump uses various HTML elements and a lot of JavaScript to create an arcade-like user interface that showcases various physics and collision calculations involved in game-making.
